Welcome to the Dev3027 blog. This is a personal project of mine that I have been interested in for quit some time. This is several years in the making and today you have found it! In 2019 I decided to dive into the wonderful world of web development. Well that was not where I started. I started with my computer career and received several certification through them. I fell in love with Linux while going through certifications.

From there I dove into Lambda School and got through the first half which was web development. Due to some family issues I was not able to complete the software engineering half. I am frustrated over it but would not give the time I spent with my father back for anything. Gone but not forgotten, love ya pop. It was a trying time in my life but I came out the other side with a deeper respect for my father and my family.

Through my journey I have learned so many thing and continue to push forward today. Learning is a never ending journey and I have been having a ball. This blog is created for a few reasons. One, I use it to help cement the what I have learned. Two, you can use it to learn a few things. I brings a smile to my face to think of those on the same journey I am, learning from the work I have put into this.

I have built various versions of this app in several languages. Never to this extent though. I found Rails at the beginning of this year, 2024. I January I dove into Ruby with code academy. In February is when I began to play with Rails. I have to say I have truly enjoyed this journey so far. Rails and the Ruby language are magical. This project is another portfolio project that aims to wrap all my best project concepts in one nice package. I want my own little place on the internet.

Everyone seems to have FallOut fever lately, including me. The home page is modeled off the PipBoy display. I loved designing that. Originally I wanted the whole site to follow the same theme. I didn't think that through. I have been working on the design and function of the other sites for years, off and on. I love the feel of those and incorporating them into this project did not mean I had to change them. 

I am starting with the blog part of the app. I am happy with the progress I am making with it. I originally had it deployed to render, but I quickly broke it and am now looking into AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I love AWS and looked into being a Solution Architect for a second. Matter of fact the current Erudition site is a cliff notes version of the work I did. Built in NextJs and deployed on Vercel, it could use some love but boy did it come out nice, for what it is. I will move it here as the upgrade to what Erudition was supposed to be.

I hope you find value here. Wether you find entertainment or learn something, hopefully I was a bright spot in your day.

This page is not built like the others. This is a static page that looks like a feature for the blog. I have decided to treat this page like a journal as I build this site. Mainly because I wanted to keep track of my progress. So after work today I have returned to the code.

Thought - When I set up the project, I scaffolded the erudition project. After creating this journal last night I had a thought. The scaffold should have been courses and erudition should have been a static / landing page.

Thought - there should be links to my git and other social on home page. Will have to remake the icons to keep with theme. 

Thought - Does Milky need animation? That would be nice. Maybe a little bounce? Look into it. Not a priority.

Thought - set production to AWS, set a public dev back up on render? 

Here is a list Of what I am working on today.

    
        The paragraphs in the welcome letter section of the home page don't feel like paragraphs. I did not set any base css for such things, nor did I grab a reset. I should consider doing that. For now, seeing I am using tailwind, I will just set some padding.</li>
    
        Removed the Erudition controller, model, view, and all, replaced it with courses then created the landing page. Changed the routes for erudition in the nav. Pushed it up and merged.
    
    
        Located the original design for landing page of Erudition. Located the code for original site. Need to create issue to translate code for landing page. Begin reconstruction in project.
    
    
        Created external links to previous works that lead to this project. Portfolio, Erudition, and Hermit+ landing.

    Got the top section of the erudition site move and mostly translated. Pushed current code to new branch. Work continues


Friday Apr 26

    Off work today. Let's get some work done. I have decided to create the PR and merge the current status of Erudition. The other sections of the landing page and the course work should be done in increments. Keep it small. Easier to manage when looking at such a big picture. Like a change jar. A nickle doesen't look like much on it's own, but they add up in the jar.


    Moving to create the landing page for hermit+. Page and route created.

    So frustrated. I have spent the past few days on design and a working prototype for Thatch. I changed the name in hopes of getting out of the slump. I got the player working and looking good atleast. It has min functionality. I played with the eq and got it built on the page, where I want it. I got the song connected to the eq but it is not working. Also having a real issue with design. I really can't spend any more time messing with it. I need the library for another, the salt and tar project, if I take it that far. I will eventually. I love the concept, just that the music on it's own is nothing great. It is not what you make an album out of, but that is not for me to decide. At the end of the day, it is about the fact I added that functionality.


    Today I need to make up for the past few days. I really need to get this back live. To do that I think I need to add that bio column to the user table. That could break it again and I will need to dix that before setting it up. Need to create the develop branch and use that for live. That way I can better control what happens as far as breaking changes.
