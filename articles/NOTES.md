## Web Developer
  A Web Developer is a jack of all trades, master of none. For this job you need to know all the basics and best to have a specialty. There are many technologies and languages you will know if you are to be proficient as a web developer. Here are some of the categories for work for you to consider: 
  * Full Time Employee - I think most of us want this. To work for a company and be steadily employed.
  * Freelance - You work for yourself. For some, wearing all the hats is an exciting challenge.
  * StartUp - Working for a startup can be risky and rewarding, exciting.
  * Create a Product - Once you have some skills and you find the need, you can create a product or service that can bring in income.
  * Internship - Second to full time employment, here you can gain the skills and knowledge you need to reach employment, maybe make a little while your on the journey.

  Some of the skills and tech you will need to know to be a Web Developer will include:
  * How Computers Work - You don't need to know the latest processors or the performance difference between all the different hard drives. You do need to know what a hard drive is, what ram is, how they are different. What the processor is. How does the computer think and how does it understand the code you write. Why does the same web site look different on different monitors.
  * How the Internet works - What is a server and why are they a thing. Is it just a computer? Is it just the code? How does my computer know what YouTube is? You did not download it. What is a protocol thingy and does it have anything to do with taking a nap? What is REST anyway.
  * The Terminal - Once you have an idea of what a computer and a server are, then you can learn the terminal. Nearly all of the programs on a computer use it's systems for some sort of work. How can you talk directly to the computer. The terminal is where you have that conversation. Could be the most powerful tool you'll learn to use.
  * IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - The IDE is what is used to write code. It helps the developer develop. It is packed full of tools and aids that make learning and coding faster and enjoyable, if not frustrating as hell. Probably the most common IDE used today is vsCode but there are a ton to pick from. At the end of the day, it is not required for writing code. A simple text editor will do the job. A IDE is a great tool to use though.
  * HTML (Hypertext MarkUp Language) - The OG. Was invented as a way to mark up the articles that were written and shared over the network that would become the world wide web. You still needed a way to make a heading or place paragraphs. There was a new thing called a link that you could click to view related information. You needed to show the link was different from the other text that surrounded it. HTML has changed a bit over the years but it is still the foundation of the internet. Good bones.
  * CSS (Cascading Stylesheets) - You use HTML to display the heading. You use CSS to change the style of that header. With CSS you can change the colors, font styles, or further effect the layout of the page, elements, or components. HTML may be good bones, CSS makes them the pretties bone they can be.
  * Javascript - Probably the most versatile language in Web Development. Javascript brings functionality to the web.
  * Git
  * SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
  * CMS (Content Management System)
