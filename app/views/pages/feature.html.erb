            <p class="py-2" class="py-1">Welcome to the Dev3027 blog. This is a personal project of mine that I have been interested in for quit some time. This is several years in the making and today you have found it! In 2019 I decided to dive into the wonderful world of web development. Well that was not where I started. I started with my computer career and received several certification through them. I fell in love with Linux while going through certifications.</p>

            <p class="py-2">From there I dove into Lambda School and got through the first half which was web development. Due to some family issues I was not able to complete the software engineering half. I am frustrated over it but would not give the time I spent with my father back for anything. Gone but not forgotten, love ya pop. It was a trying time in my life but I came out the other side with a deeper respect for my father and my family.</p>

            <p class="py-2">Through my journey I have learned so many thing and continue to push forward today. Learning is a never ending journey and I have been having a ball. This blog is created for a few reasons. One, I use it to help cement the what I have learned. Two, you can use it to learn a few things. I brings a smile to my face to think of those on the same journey I am, learning from the work I have put into this.</p>

            <p class="py-2">I have built various versions of this app in several languages. Never to this extent though. I found Rails at the beginning of this year, 2024. In January I dove into Ruby with code academy. In February is when I began to play with Rails. I have to say I have truly enjoyed this journey so far. Rails and the Ruby language are magical. This project is another portfolio project that aims to wrap all my best project concepts in one nice package. I want my own little place on the internet.</p>

            <p class="py-2">Everyone seems to have FallOut fever lately, including me. The home page is modeled off the PipBoy display. I loved designing that. Originally I wanted the whole site to follow the same theme. I didn't think that through. I have been working on the design and function of the other sites for years, off and on. I love the feel of those and incorporating them into this project did not mean I had to change them. </p>

            <p class="py-2">I am starting with the blog part of the app. I am happy with the progress I am making with it. I originally had it deployed to render, but I quickly broke it and am now looking into AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I love AWS and looked into being a Solution Architect for a second. Matter of fact the current Erudition site is a cliff notes version of the work I did. Built in NextJs and deployed on Vercel, it could use some love but boy did it come out nice, for what it is. I will move it here as the upgrade to what Erudition was supposed to be.</p>

            <p class="py-2">I hope you find value here. Wether you find entertainment or learn something, hopefully I was a bright spot in your day.</p>

            <p>This page is not built like the others. This is a static page that looks like a feature for the blog. I have decided to treat this page like a journal as I build this site. Mainly because I wanted to keep track of my progress. So after work today I have returned to the code. Here is a list Of what I am working on today.</p>
            <ul class="bg-slate-200 my-2 p-1">
                <li class="list-disc">The paragraphs in the welcome letter section of the home page don't feel like paragraphs. I did not set any base css for such things, nor did I grab a reset. I should consider doing that. For now, seeing I am using tailwind, I will just set some padding.</li>
