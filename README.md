# MILK README

Welcome to MILK. This project includes several different project woven into one. Many of these are built to various extent using tech like React, NextJs, Node, Express, NestJs, MongoDb, PostgresQl. I used ORM like Prisma and TypeOrm. I used AWS, Azure, and FireBase. I have used Vercel, Netlify, Render, and Heroku. I have enjoyed playing with all of them, but nothing compares to the ease of use and joy I have using Rails and the Ruby language.

This project is still very fluid as redesigns happen daily for the design, layout, feel, and functionality . It was started toward the beginning of April, end of March, 2024. The start of 2024 had me diving into Ruby. Once I had a handle on that I moved to Rails and this project. Wrapping all my favorite past projects from the past years into one is a dream and a challenge.

MILK will have many sections, all should have the feel of separate sites and will have different functionality. Listed below is the technical info for the build and further down is info on the different sections. The current goal is to have at least the landings and aux sections complete by May 21, 2024.

This project will be free to review. It will encourage donations like code academy. So there will be:
* User - is not logged in. Visitor to site, general public.
* Member - holds account, can log in, has profile, can comment or create.
* Admin - has access to functionality of site CRUD actions.

Things you may want to know:
